# pgh-juvenile-arrests
Pittsburgh juvenile arrests data analysis for 90.5 WESA story

This is the best way to see my code:
Jupyter notebook on nbviewer (so you can see the plotly plots):
http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ZacharyGoldstein/pgh-juvenile-arrests/blob/master/Arrest%20Data%20EDA.ipynb
You can also look at the notebook directly in github, but the plots will not display.

Here is the article I wrote using this data:

Here is the source of the data on the WPRDC page:
https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/arrest-data

I also uploaded the original dataset, a modified dataset showing only juvenile arrests, and some still images of the plots.
